### profile

#### personal profile
I want to make a personal profile that can be browsed in any devices, so create a web application is a good idea. this time I choose Vue framework to simplify my work, my target is to build a configurable, responsive, gorgeous personal profile.

#### dependency
I consider that maybe I don't need some UI FrameWork(like antd or element-ui and so on),the projects will be based on following tips
1. vue - offer component capacity
2. less - in order to customize ui, less can help me simplify my css code
3. some icon lib and fonts file

#### how to use?
I use [@vue-cli3.0](https://cli.vuejs.org), so if you have installed it onn your environment, it's really simple to use, you can see detail about it in site.

**Strongly Recommend**
`vue ui`
